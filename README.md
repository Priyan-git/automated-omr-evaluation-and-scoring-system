**üß† OMR-Automate:**


 AI-Powered Optical Mark Recognition and Scoring System
A complete, end-to-end system designed to automate the tedious process of grading OMR sheets. This project transforms a manual, time-consuming task into a fast, accurate, and auditable digital workflow.


**üéØ Project Overview**


OMR-Automate is a sophisticated application engineered to address the challenges of traditional OMR sheet grading. By leveraging a powerful computer vision pipeline, the system intelligently analyzes scanned images, scores them against a provided answer key, and presents the results in a professional web interface. This not only accelerates the evaluation process but also introduces a crucial layer of transparency and accuracy.
Designed from a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD), the architecture prioritizes modularity, precision, and a "human-in-the-loop" review process, targeting an exceptional error tolerance of less than 0.5%.


**‚ú® Key Features**


üì∏ Advanced Image Processing:   
A robust OpenCV-powered pipeline automatically corrects for perspective distortion, rotation, and lighting variations, ensuring reliable analysis from any image source.

ü§ñ Intelligent Bubble Analysis:
 The system employs advanced contour detection and a bespoke sorting algorithm to precisely locate every bubble in the correct reading order, adeptly handling complex, multi-column layouts.

‚úÖ High-Accuracy Scoring:
 Rather than relying on a single global threshold, the application uses localized Otsu's binarization on each bubble individually, allowing it to accurately interpret faint or partially erased marks.

üíª Professional Review UI:
 A modern, decoupled frontend built with Next.js and React provides a sophisticated and intuitive dashboard for evaluators to review, filter, and manually correct results.

üîó Decoupled Architecture:
 A high-performance FastAPI backend serves the core computer vision logic as a web service, allowing any modern frontend to connect and interact with the system seamlessly.

üîë Flexible Answer Key Management:
 The system dynamically loads answer keys from complex, multi-column .xlsx files, making it highly adaptable to various exam formats without code changes.

üî¨ Ready for Machine Learning:
 The integrated review UI is designed for "human-in-the-loop" feedback, enabling the effortless collection and labeling of bubble images to train a future ML classifier for even greater accuracy.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The application is built with a modern, decoupled architecture, leveraging best-in-class tools for both the backend processing and the frontend user experience.

**Process pipline:**
The Processing Pipeline
The system follows a modular, multi-step pipeline to ensure accuracy and auditability at every stage:
Upload: An evaluator uploads the OMR sheet image and an Excel answer key via the React frontend.
API Request: The frontend securely transmits the files to the FastAPI backend.

Image Rectification:
 The backend prepares the image for analysis, correcting for any skew or distortion.
Bubble Detection:
 The system uses cv2.findContours to identify all potential bubbles on the sheet.
Intelligent Sorting:
 The detected bubbles are algorithmically sorted into the correct reading order.
Answer Analysis:
 Each bubble is individually analyzed to determine if it has been marked by the student.
Scoring:
 The system cross-references the student's answers with the parsed answer key.
JSON Response:
 The backend returns a detailed JSON object containing the final score and a full answer breakdown.
UI Rendering:
 The React frontend receives the JSON and dynamically displays the results in the dashboard for review.

**üöÄ Getting Started**

To run this project locally, you will need two separate terminals: one for the backend and one for the frontend.


```
python Prerequisites
python
Python 3.9+
Node.js and npm
```
```
1. Backend Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [your-repo-name]

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
python -m uvicorn backend:app --reload


The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
2. Frontend Setup
# In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

The project transforms a manual, time-consuming task into a fast, accurate, and auditable digital workflow.This application takes a scanned image or photograph of a completed OMR sheet, intelligently processes it using a robust computer vision pipeline, and scores it against a provided answer key. The results are then presented in a professional, modern web interface where an evaluator can review the automated scoring and make manual corrections, ensuring 100% accuracy and maintaining a full audit trail.This project is a direct implementation of a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD), focusing on modularity, accuracy, and a human-in-the-loop review process to achieve an error tolerance of less than 0.5%.‚ú® Key Featuresüì∏ Advanced Image Processing: Utilizes an OpenCV-powered pipeline to handle perspective correction, rotation, and lighting variations, ensuring accurate bubble detection from any image source.ü§ñ Intelligent Bubble Analysis: Employs robust contour detection and sorting algorithms to precisely locate and identify every bubble in the correct reading order, accommodating complex, multi-column layouts.‚úÖ High-Accuracy Scoring: Uses localized Otsu's thresholding for each bubble to accurately determine if it's filled, minimizing errors from faint or incomplete marks.üíª Professional Review UI: A modern, decoupled frontend built with Next.js and React provides a sophisticated dashboard for evaluators to review results, filter answers, and make manual corrections.üîó Decoupled Architecture: A high-performance FastAPI backend serves the computer vision logic, allowing any modern frontend to connect and interact with the system.üîë Flexible Answer Key Management: Dynamically loads answer keys from complex, multi-column .xlsx files, making the system adaptable to various exam formats.üî¨ Ready for Machine Learning: The system is built with a "human-in-the-loop" design, enabling the collection and labeling of bubble images to train a future ML classifier for even higher accuracy.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackThe application is built with a modern, decoupled architecture, leveraging the best tools for both the backend processing and the frontend user experience.CategoryTechnologyPurposeBackendPythonCore programming languageFastAPIHigh-performance API framework for serving the backend logicOpenCVThe core library for all computer vision and image processing tasksPandasReading and parsing the Excel answer key filesUvicornASGI server for running the FastAPI applicationFrontendNext.jsReact framework for building the user interfaceReactThe core UI libraryTypeScriptFor type safety and robust frontend developmentTailwind CSSFor styling the modern user interfaceshadcn/uiFor professional, accessible, and themeable UI components‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Processing PipelineThe system follows a modular, multi-step pipeline to ensure accuracy and auditability at every stage.Image Upload: The user uploads an OMR sheet image and an Excel answer key via the React frontend.API Request: The frontend sends the files to the FastAPI backend.Perspective Correction (Implied): The backend prepares the image for analysis.Bubble Detection: The system uses cv2.findContours to identify all potential bubbles on the sheet.Intelligent Sorting: The detected bubbles are sorted into the correct reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to match the question sequence.Answer Analysis: Each bubble is individually analyzed using Otsu's thresholding to determine if it is filled.Scoring: The detected answers are compared against the parsed answer key to calculate the final score.JSON Response: The backend returns a detailed JSON object with the score, a breakdown of all answers, and the correct answers.UI Rendering: The React frontend receives the JSON and displays the results in the professional dashboard.üöÄ Getting StartedTo run this project locally, you will need two separate terminals: one for the backend and one for the frontend.PrerequisitesPython 3.9+Node.js and npm1. Backend Setup# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [your-repo-name]

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the backend server
python -m uvicorn backend:app --reload
The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.2. Frontend Setup# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory in a NEW terminal
cd frontend

# 2. Install npm packages
npm install

# 3. Run the frontend development server
npm run dev
